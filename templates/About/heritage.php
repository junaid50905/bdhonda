                            cc
                            Gold Wing GL1000, the King of Motorcycles in the American market. It was initially imported
                            from
                            Japan, but as demand grew, production was moved to Honda of America Manufacturing (HAM) in
                            1980.

                            Honda continued to improve its technologies through competition, leading to its first
                            championship in 1979, in the 500cc class ridden by Graham Noyce. This laid the foundations
                            for

                            In 1961, Honda began knockdown production in Taiwan. In 1963, Honda forayed into the
                            European
                            market by commencing moped production in Belgium. Since then, Honda expanded its production
                            bases worldwide, and by 1997, was producing vehicles at 32 bases in 27 countries.
