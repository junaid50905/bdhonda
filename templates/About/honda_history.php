                    brand is nothing more than the history of our challenges and achievements in creating values,
                    invariably ahead of our time. It is also the history of the dreams of each of our associates that
                    have come true and have been shared by people around the world.<br><br>
                    Honda Motor Company Ltd. formally established in 1948 with its co-founders Soichiro Honda and Takeo
                    Fujisawa and introduces (in 1949) its first original designed and engineered product which Mr. Honda
                    appropriately names the “Dream” D-type motorcycle. The close partnership between Soichiro Honda and
                    Fujisawa lasted until they stepped down together in October 1973.

                        alt="Smiley face" width="150" height="141" align="right" hspace="20"> In January 1953, Honda
                    moved its Head Office, the site of today’s Honda Yaesu Building. That same January the company
                    bought a 100,000 square-meter site at Yamato-machi, Saitama Prefecture, and started construction of
                    the Yamato Plant. In April the Shirako Plant was completed and started full-scale
                    production.<br><br>
                    Honda Power Products operations started with the desire to apply engine technologies in ways useful
                    for people's daily lives and work situations. Beginning in 1953 with a general-purpose engine
                    developed for agricultural equipment, the power products business has now passed its 60th year of
                    offering an ever-expanding set of products including generators, tillers, snow throwers, and
                    outboard engines.

                    Honda began to produce automobiles. Honda Motor Company grew in a short time to become the world's
                    largest manufacturer of motorcycles by 1964. The introduction of the 4-cylinder Honda CB750 in 1969
                    brings a new level of sophistication to mainstream motorcycles. Over the next few decades, Honda
                    worked to expand its product line and expanded operations and exports to numerous countries around
                    the world.<br><br>
                    Honda launches Acura in 1986, the first luxury nameplate from a Japanese automaker, with sales of
                    “precision crafted performance.”&nbsp;"Utilizing technology to help people", Honda has been
                    conducting R&amp;D on humanoid robots, to realize the dream of being useful to people and to help
                    enrich our human society and people’s daily lives. The wide-ranging technologies and experience
                    cultivated through this challenge also have been applied to other products, leading to various
                    initiatives with the aim of creating totally new value.

                    become one of the most popular Honda public-facing personalities.<br><br>

                    under Honda's name.The result is Honda Jet Cleared For Takeoff in 2015. The highly anticipated
                    HondaJet achieves type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and enters into
                    service. First customer deliveries begin just two weeks later.
