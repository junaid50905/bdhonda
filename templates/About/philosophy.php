                <p>
                    The Honda Philosophy consists of Fundamental Beliefs (including "Respect for the Individual" and
                    "The Three Joys"), the Company Principle, and Management Policies. This philosophy is not only
                    shared by
                    all associates, but also forms the basis for all company activities and sets the standard for the
                    conduct and decision-making of all associates throughout the Honda Group. Driven by its dreams and
                    reflecting its values, Honda will continue taking on challenges to share joys and excitement with
                    customers and communities around the world to strive to become a company society wants to exist.

                <h4 align="center">Respect for the Individual</h4><br>
                <p style="text-align: center"><img

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Initiative</h4>
                <p>Initiative means not to be bound by preconceived ideas, but to think creatively and act on your own
                    initiative and judgment, while understanding that you must take responsibility for the results of
                    those
                    actions.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Equality</h4>
                <p>Equality means to recognize and respect individual differences in one another and treat each other
                    fairly. Our company is committed to this principle and to creating equal opportunities for each
                    individual. An individual's race, gender, age, religion, national origin, educational background,
                    social
                    or economic status has no bearing on the individual's opportunities.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Trust</h4>
                <p>The relationship among associates at Honda should be based on mutual trust. Trust is created by
                    recognizing each other as individuals, helping out where others are deficient, accepting help where
                    we
                    are deficient, sharing our knowledge, and making a sincere effort to fulfill our responsibilities.

                <h4 align="center">The Three Joys</h4><br>

                <h4>The Joy of Buying</h4>
                <p>The joy of buying is achieved through providing products and services that exceed the needs and
                    expectations of each customer.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>The Joy of Selling</h4>
                <p>The joy of selling occurs when those who are engaged in selling and servicing Honda products develop
                    relationships with a customer based on mutual trust. Through this relationship, Honda associates,
                    dealers and distributors experience pride and joy in satisfying the customer and in representing
                    Honda
                    to the customer.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>The Joy of Creating</h4>
                <p>The joy of creating occurs when Honda associates and suppliers involved in the design, development,
                    engineering and manufacturing of Honda products recognize a sense of joy in our customers and
                    dealers.
                    The joy of creating occurs when quality products exceed expectations and we experience pride in a
                    job
                    well done.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
